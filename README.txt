This game is all about lighting. There is no natural light in this game. You're equipped with a flashlight and must continue moving forward until the end.
Level 1 utilizes many colliders to create a dark, horror-like atmosphere. Things will appear and/or disappear - such as vanishing lights.
Level 2 has a bit more moving parts, lighting and lighting timers, color changing objects and rigidbodies.
Level 3 utilizes more destroyable doors and proximity sensors as well as moving and rotating objects.
All levels have a bit of everything to create a strange atmosphere.
